# Machine Learning Workshop 2025

Welcome to the Machine Learning Workshop 2025 repository! This repository contains resources and code related to various topics covered in the workshop. The workshop covers essential concepts in machine learning using popular datasets such as the Iris Dataset and the Image Digits Dataset.

## Topics Covered

### 01. The Iris Dataset
Explore the famous Iris Dataset, a classic dataset in the field of machine learning. Understand its structure, features, and target classes.

### 02. Visualizing the Iris Dataset
Learn how to visually analyze the Iris Dataset using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Plot different attributes to gain insights into the data.

### 03. Machine Learning with Iris Dataset
Dive into machine learning with the Iris Dataset. Implement classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest, to predict Iris flower types.

### 04. The Image Digits Dataset
Introduce yourself to the Image Digits Dataset, containing hand-written digit images. Understand its structure and the task of digit classification.

### 05. Visualizing the Digits Dataset
Explore visualization techniques for the Image Digits Dataset. Visualize the images and features to better understand the dataset.

### 06. Machine Learning with Digits Dataset
Apply machine learning techniques to the Image Digits Dataset. Train models like such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest to predict the digit in the images.
